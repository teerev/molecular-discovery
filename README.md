Experiments with the PubChem database

This workflow is currently based in a JupyterLab environment using RDKit. Because RDKit has non-Python dependencies, it runs in a Docker container. 

You can just run the ````run.sh```` convenience script to create the image, container, and start JupyterLab in your browser at localhost:8888:

````bash
./run.sh
````
